# Civilizations And Tribes: War Of Faith
**Civilization** the most advanced stage of human, social, polical and cultural development and organization at a grand scale that culminated in the formation of a nation or **empire**. On the other hand, we have **tribes** that are a peoples that ethnically, politically and socially cohesive but "lack" the size and organization and oftem depicted as savages by the empires around them but are they really disorganized and barbaric? we'll have to see.

**Carroballista** was an ancient, cart-mounted ballista, a type of mobile field artillery. According to the Roman author Vegetius, each legion had 55 _carroballistae_ which were arrow/bolt-shooter of the _[cheiroballistra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheiroballistra "Cheiroballistra")_ type. Vegetius tells us that each _carroballista_ was carried by mules and operated by one _[contubernium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contubernium_(Roman_army_unit))_ (i.e., eight soldiers commanded by one _[decanus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decanus "Decanus")_). Surviving representation of a _carroballista_ are from the bas-reliefs of [Trajan's Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column "Trajan's Column") (Scene XL and Scenes LXV/LXVI) and the [Column of Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_of_Marcus_Aurelius "Column of Marcus Aurelius").
